Include images from Screenshot Machine in your content with a shortcode.

== Description ==

Use the `&#91;ssm&#93;` shortcode in your content with the following arguments:

* key="{account key}"
* size="{size letter}" (default=T)
* url="{website url}"
* title="{href title}"
* link="{yes|no}" (default=yes)
* blank="{yes|no}" (default=yes)
* refresh="{yes|no}" (default=yes)

You can find the {account key} on [your Screenshot Machine account/settings page](https://www.screenshotmachine.com/account.php).

Valid {size letter} values are:

* T = Width 120 x Height 90
* S = Width 200 x Height 150
* E = Width 320 x Height 240
* N = Width 400 x Height 300
* M = Width 640 x Height 480
* L = Width 800 x Height 600
* X = Width 1024 x Height 768

The {website url} is the web page URL to capture into a screenshot.

{href title} is the title text for the image alt and link title.

The link yes/no value will determine if the image is linked to the web page URL or not.

If blank is set to yes, the link will be opened in a new window / tab.

The refresh parameter includes javascript to retry the image every second until it's available (for a maximum of 10 seconds).

Example:

`
&#91;ssm key="abc123" url="http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/ssm-shortcode/" size="S"&#93;
